# CSS Styles: Inline, Internal, and External

## 1. Inline CSS
Inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element. The CSS is added directly within the HTML tag, using the `style` attribute.

### Syntax:
```html
<p style="color: red; font-size: 16px;">This is an inline-styled paragraph.</p>

```

### Key Points:
- The `style` attribute is used inside the HTML element.
- Useful for applying specific styling to a single element.
- Not recommended for larger projects due to lack of scalability and reusability.
- Can be useful for quick fixes or temporary styling.
- Can be overridden by other styles (e.g., internal or external styles).
- Can be a security risk if not properly sanitized, as it can lead to XSS attacks.

## 2. Internal CSS or Embedded
Internal CSS is defined within the `<style>` tag, located in the `<head>` section of an HTML document. This CSS applies to the entire document, allowing you to style multiple elements from one place.

### Syntax:
```html
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: blue;
      font-size: 18px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>This is a paragraph styled using internal CSS.</p>
</body>
```

### Key Points:
- Defined inside a `<style>` element in the HTML `<head>` section.
- Styles are scoped to the HTML document where they are declared.
- Suitable for smaller projects or pages with limited styling.
- Can be easily updated or modified without affecting external styles.
- Can be overridden by external styles.

## 3. External CSS
External CSS is written in a separate `.css` file and is linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag. This method keeps the HTML structure clean and allows for efficient styling of multiple pages.

### Syntax:
**HTML:**
```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <p>This is a paragraph styled using external CSS.</p>
</body>
```

**CSS (styles.css):**
```css
p {
  color: green;
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

### Key Points:
- CSS rules are stored in a separate `.css` file.
- Allows for reusability across multiple HTML files.
- Ideal for large-scale projects with consistent styling requirements.
